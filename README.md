# **MAR Interface**

The *MAR (Method-Approach-Recommendation) interface* is a [Streamlit](//) Python-based web application meant to provide a preliminary statistical overview on low-dimensional and non-time series datasets. The primary goal is to assist users in selecting the most appropriate machine learning method as well as missing data handling approaches: the application analyzes the dataset, performs quality checks, identifies variable types, and provides recommendations on which statistical method is the most appropriate to conduct an analysis with. Each step is treated as an easily editable block, in order to further provide adjustments and fine-tuning on thresholds and criterias chosen on necessity. This interface is and was meant as nothing more then a curricular project started within universitary activities.
