The MAR Algorithm (Method-Approach-Recommendation) is a Streamlit-based interface designed to provide recommendations on Machine Learning algorithms based on the characteristics of a given dataset. The primary goal is to assist users in selecting the most appropriate machine learning method based on the provided data.

The application analyzes the dataset, performs quality checks, identifies variable types, and provides recommendations on which machine learning algorithms to use for classification.
